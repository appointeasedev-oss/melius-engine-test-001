However, there are some minor issues: 1) The MiniBox component has a typo in the second instance where 'Talented people' para attribute is incorrectly formatted, 2) Some className values could be extracted to CSS classes for better maintainability, 3) The component could benefit from better semantic HTML structure.", "improvement_opportunities": ["Fix the MiniBox component prop typo", "Extract repeated className patterns to CSS classes", "Add semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility", "Consider adding PropTypes for better type checking"]}}}

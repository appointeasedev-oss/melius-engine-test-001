{"files_to_read": ["/src/components/Page1Content.js", "/src/components/Page1Slider.js"], "analysis": "The Page1 component has repetitive code structure for each slide. Each slide has the same layout with only content and image changing. This violates DRY principles and makes maintenance difficult. The component also has hardcoded values (300%, 33.333%, 100/3) that should be derived from constants.", "improvement_plan": "1. Extract slide data into an array of objects containing head, para, and image source\n2. Create a Slide component to encapsulate the repeated structure\n3. Map over the slides array to render each slide dynamically\n4. Use constants for slide calculations to improve maintainability\n5. Remove redundant arrow navigation elements by rendering them conditionally", "files_to_write": ["/src/components/Page1.js"]}
